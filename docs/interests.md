- programming
	- I write a lot of code in my free time - much of it mediocre and lost
- tech & gadgets
	- I read **a lot** about technology
	- soft spot for backing frivolous things on Kickstarter
- online gaming
	- team-based, objective games like Overwatch
- crafting
	- this is currently leatherwork
	- also building. from home improvement to furniture
	- classic pickup trucks (no current project)
- tattoos
	- oddly, the process is more interesting than the final product

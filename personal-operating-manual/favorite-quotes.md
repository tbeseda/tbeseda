> **On a long enough timeline, I'm usually right.**

â€“ *my hubris and humility all at once*

- I've always got opinions + ideas
- They can, and do shift - I'm eager to learn things
- Even after enough time, I may be wrong
	- But usually not ðŸ˜Ž

Not dissimilar to "Strong opinions weakly held"

> **It ain't what it isn't.**

â€“ *some traditional country songwriter. Brent Cobb?* Twain has a version

Sometimes: "It ain't what it ain't," but that's excessive.

Obviously, it's the inverted double negative of "It is what it is." Usually it means the same: a sort of radical acceptance, but there's also a reminder that *it* isn't necessarily what you think it is. I try to check my preconceived notions and catastrophizing.

- "It ainâ€™t what you donâ€™t know that gets you into trouble. Itâ€™s what you know for sure that just ainâ€™t so." â€“ unknown (not Twain)
